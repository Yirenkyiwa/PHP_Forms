This repository is a PHP task given to us by ZuriBoard team. 
The 'index.php' file contains a simple html form that takes user inputs. 
The 'index.php' submits user input to 'user_data.php' file using the 'POST' method.
The 'user_data.php' file retrieves the user input and stores all user input in a csv file called 'userdata.csv'
The 'userdata.csv' file stores all user data submitted through the form in order.
